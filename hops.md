A hop 
 -a packet passes through a router
 IPV4 has a mechanism called  time to live  - its  a field found in the header of an IP packet.The TTL field is numerical that represents the maximum number of hops (ROUTERS OR Networks Segments) that a packet can traverse before being discarded.
 -The primary purpose of the TTL field is to prevent packets from circulating indefinitely in a network which could happen if there were routing loops.
 When you ping an IP address and see the "TTL" (Time to Live) value displayed in the response, it represents the number of hops (routers or network segments) that the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request packet can take before it reaches its destination.
 When you ping an IP address and see the "TTL" (Time to Live) value displayed in the response, it represents the number of hops (routers or network segments) that the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request packet can take before it reaches its destination. This value indicates the remaining number of hops between your computer and the target IP address. It's important to note that in the output of the ping command, you often see it displayed as "TTL=" followed by a number.

Here's what different TTL values typically indicate:

TTL = 225: A TTL value of 225 indicates that there are approximately 225 hops (routers or network segments) between your computer and the destination. This number can vary depending on the specific network path and routing configuration. In general, larger TTL values suggest a longer network path.

TTL = 64: A TTL value of 64 is a common default value that is often set for packets. This is a common starting point for TTL values in many operating systems. It means that the packet can traverse up to 64 hops before reaching its destination.

As the packet travels through the network, each router it encounters will decrement the TTL value by one. If the TTL reaches zero, the router will discard the packet and send an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message back to the source. This mechanism helps prevent packets from looping indefinitely in a network.

The TTL value in a ping response can be a useful diagnostic tool for understanding the network path and identifying potential issues, such as excessively long routes or routing loops. It's important to note that the TTL value may not always be an exact representation of the number of hops but provides a rough estimate of the distance between your computer and the destination. Additionally, different devices or operating systems may use different default TTL values, so you might see variations in practice.
